            Ryan Croke served as Chief of Staff in the Illinois Department of

He volunteers as a board member on the District 186 Public Schools Foundation and as President of the Mid-Illinois Medical District Commission. In 2019 the German Marshall Fund of the United States selected him as a Marshall Memorial Fellow.
